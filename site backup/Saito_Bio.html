Morihiro Saito, a native of Iwama, joined the Iwama Dojo as a live-in student
at age 18. He was to become one of O-sensei's closest disciples, spending
nearly every day with him for 23 years. After O-Sensei's death in 1969, Aikido
spread out into several different lineages or styles under O-Sensei's various
disciples. Saito Shihan, however, remained in Iwama as head instructor of the
Iwama Dojo. He took it as his duty to preserve aikido's roots--what he calls
&quot;the Founder's techniques&quot;--the locks and throws O-Sensei taught on a daily
basis at the Iwama Dojo. Saito Shihan's own innovation was to develop a
systematic method for transmitting the Founder's techniques. This method has
become known as the &quot;Iwama Style.&quot; The style stresses mental focus and
coordinated body movement as the source of power in techniques. While Aikido's
spiritual values are essential to the practice, they are nurtured non-verbally
through sincere training and cooperation among the trainees.
