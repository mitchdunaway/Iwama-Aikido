<P><B>June 26, 2002 - </B>Thanks to everybody who turned out this past Wednesday. Your support is greatly appreciated!<BR>
Alexander Sensei will be teaching one night next week. Check back soon to find out what night.<BR>
Another copy of Saito Sensei's hard to find Traditional Aikido series is up on eBay. It's a copy of Volume 1 with the original cover style. Click <A href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=1546135733">here</A> to view the auction. Westlake Village Aikido does not endorse the quality of the seller, just the quality of the book.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>June 26, 2002 - </B>There is no training on Thursday, July 4th. Classes will resume on Friday, July 5th.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>June 24, 2002 - </B>It has been confirmed, Alexander Sensei will be teaching class this coming Wednesday! This is an important training day so, if it is at all possible, please attend.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>June 23, 2002 - </B>Video footage was recorded today for the upcoming public access Traditional Aikido show.  The only things missing are some shots from an actual Westlake Village Aikido training session.  I intend to capture this missing footage this coming Wednesday, June 26th.  I would obviously like to have the mat as filled with students as possible.  It would be really helpful if all students enrolled (and some who haven't made it in a while) could show up for this class.  As an added bonus, Alexander Sensei will be teaching the class!<BR>
Please come out to support your dojo.  Your presence will be greatly appreciated!</P>

<P><B>June 19, 2002 - </B>For those who attended any of Saito Sensei's seminars in America over the past 5 years or so, you may remember his translator, a gentleman named Mark Larson. Mark Larson was fortunate enough to study with Saito Sensei for nine years. He has written a tribute to Saito Sensei and posted it on aikidojournal.com. I have provided a link here.  I thought it was really nice remembrance. <A href="http://65.119.177.201/cgi-bin/ubb/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic&f=9&t=001308">True to the Way</A>.</P>
