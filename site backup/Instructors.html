In 1919, he turned towards the spiritual, pacifistic teachings of the Omoto religion and started to develop the Art of Peace. In 1942,<BR>
in the midst of the chaos of World War II, O-Sensei named his new martial art <STRONG>Aikido</STRONG>, and moved to the small country town of Iwama.<BR>
There he continued to practice, teach and refine Aikido until he passed away in 1969. </P></TD></TR>

but a close confidant of O-Sensei for the following 23 years. After the founder's death, he was put in charge of the Iwama dojo<BR>
and became the guardian of the Aiki-shrine. Today, he is also known for his books, his clear and structured way of teaching,<BR>
and the organization of the huge number of techniques that comprise <STRONG>Iwama-style Aikido</STRONG>. It is through Saito Sensei's<BR>
timeless Iwama style techniques, that the teachers and students of Westlake Village Aikido will always remember him.</P></TD></TR>

Prior to that time he dabbled in various<BR>other styles of martial arts but frequent moving prevented him from becoming grounded<BR>anywhere. Twelve years ago he found Alexander Sensei and has been there ever since.<BR>Rodgers Sensei believes an honest approach to your training is best suited to your<BR>survival in this world. Acknowledging your chosen style's strengths is easy, but<BR>acknowledging your style's weakness and doing something about it, is not.<BR>To that end he is always on the lookout for something he can "steal" from<BR>other martial art styles and has been training Karate for the past&nbsp;ten years.</P></TD></TR>

After the dojo moved, Powell Sensei could no<BR>longer make it to the class, but that brief experience was enough to hook him for life.<BR>He spent the next 15 years looking for something to fill his need for Aikido.<BR>He trained Tang-Soo-Do from 1983 to 1987 while stationed at<BR>Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas.<BR>From 1987 to 1988 it was Tae-Kwan-Do while stationed in Taegu, Korea.<BR>Then there was Kempo Karate from 1990 to 1992 in Newbury Park, California.<BR>Powell Sensei finally found Alexander Sensei in 1993 and he's been here ever since.<BR>Powell Sensei feels that "Training Aikido (with Alexander Sensei) has filled a large<BR>void left in my life that was created in '78".</P></TD></TR>
