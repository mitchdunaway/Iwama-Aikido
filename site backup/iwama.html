								Iwama is a small
								country village a set in a quiet farming area about 1 hour and 30mins train
								ride north-east of Tokyo on the Mito line. It is famous in the Aikido world
								for being the home the Aiki-jinja (the Aikido shrine), and the Iwama Dojo,
								which served as a home to O-Sensei when he moved from Tokyo to the country
								in 1942. Apparently it was a dream of O-Sensei to lead a relaxed and healthy
								country life, mixing farming with Martial Arts training. Here he was able
								to develop his ideas into the art we know today. The Iwama Dojo is one
								of the few remaining traditional "old style" training centres in Japan.
								It is set in roughly 17 acres of beautiful oak forest and remains practically
								the same as it was 50 years ago

								Training is twice a day,
								morning and evening, Monday to Saturday. Students can live at the Dojo
								as "Uchi-deshi", (inside students), or as the locals and the longer term
								foreigners usually do, train as "Soto-deshi" (outside students). The uchi
								deshi cook their own meals, do the chores around the Dojo and immerse themselves
								in the training life of traditional Budo, by receiving the favoured teaching
								of Saito Sensei. Extra training is also undertaken when University groups
								come to Iwama for special intensive periods, so students could be training
								anything up to 4- hours a day. Training is tough, and discipline is strict;
								students are expected to conform to the traditional Japanese way, this
								not only develops great inner strength, but also builds solid character.More
								importantly, students who have spent time at Iwama exhibit a strength and
								sharpness of technique that is characteristic of such intense study, and
								develop into teachers of the highest calibre.

							The Aikido shrine, which occupies

							completed before the dojo, in 1944. It was built to O-Sensei's plan based
							on principles of Kotodama, utilising it's component forms; the triangle,
							circle and square. It enshrines 43 deities, to whom O-Sensei prayed almost
							every day. In 1962, a Ceremonial Hall in front of the shrine was completed,
							and that is what the visitor sees today. Since O-Sensei's passing in 1969,
							both the Shrine and the Dojo have been left in the care of Saito Sensei.
							Regular Ceremonies are held at the Shrine, with the present Doshu and visitors
							from Tokyo coming to join in rememberence of O-Sensei and other important
							Shinto dates.

							Morihiro Saito Sensei, 9th

							Saito Sensei
							was born near Iwama, and was a railway worker for many of his earlier years.
							He originally came from a karate background, and had done some kendo, as
							so many Aikido practioners do. In those early years, Saito Sensei was famous
							for his strength and vigorous training method. Stories of him travelling
							to Tokyo and picking fights with gangsters, to test the Aikido techniques
							he learnt are told in the same breath as praise for his ability as a teacher
							providing clear, systematic and easy to understand instruction.

					<p>
					<font face="Arial,Helvetica">
						<font size=-1>
							Now that Saito Sensei is
							in his 70's, it is evident that his Aikido has changed, yet older students
							at the seminars still report that his throws "still have that power", and
							his footwork is just as fast and precise as ever.
						</font>

					<p>
					<font face="Arial,Helvetica">

							Saito Sensei appreciates
							that he will not be in this world forever, and so has asked many of his
							top students, who are now instructors with their own dojo around the world,
							to be active in preserving the Martial Art of O-Sensei. At the most recent
							seminar in Sydney, he spoke of some who believe weapons are not necessary
							in Aikido, and others who have begun to change the art to suit their own
							means. Saito Sensei believes that what O-Sensei left the world is a valuable
							legacy, and would like to see it preserved for future generations.

							physical action. Lord Yagyu, upon remembering the famous horseman Magaki
							Heikuro riding up and down the stairs at Atago on horseback, was unable
							to perform the feat himself. Takuan rode the stairs easily, saying "there
							is no horseman on horseback, nor horse under the saddle."
