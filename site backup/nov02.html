Another copy of Saito Sensei's "Aikido: Its Heart and Appearance" has become available on eBay <A href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=1971086229">here</A>.  This time it's a second printing but regardless, the book is still very good and hard to find.  Easily of the same caliber as any of Saito Sensei's "Traditional Aikido" books!</P>
