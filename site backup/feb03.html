<P><B>February 18, 2003 - </B>eBay auction alert: Saito Sensei's <A href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=3500951154&category=2239">Traditional Aikido Volume 1</A> and Saito Sensei's <A href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=3500952885&category=2239">Traditional Aikido Volume 2</A>.

<P><B>February 3, 2003 - </B>There is another full 5 volume set of Saito Sensei's Traditional Aikido books on eBay. This set seems to be a 1992 reprint of the series.
