<P><B>June 21, 2003</B> - The Koga seminar is today!  Please be sure to be at the seminar at least fifteen minutes early (9:45am).  Koga Sensei does not train in a gi.  He prefers a t-shirt and sweats.  There will not be a lunch break.  There will be a party immediately afterward for all attendees.  The part will be at Allen's house.  You may download directions to the party <A href="docs/kogaparty02.doc">here</A>.  Bandits BBQ will be provided!</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>June 9, 2003</B> - Our Practical Aikido seminar with Koga Sensei is fast approaching. We do have a few spaces available so please sign up if you haven't already.  If you've already registered, remember that Koga Sensei trains in a t-shirt and sweats, not a keiko gi.  Any type of comfortable street clothes will do.<BR>
In other news, Westlake Village Aikido's public access show, "Traditional Aikido", is now on Saturday mornings at 11am.  Catch it on Adelphia's public access channel.</P>
