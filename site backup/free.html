<P>Once enrolled at Westlake Village Aikido, any student who gets a friend, relative, or acquaintance to sign up will receive half off their tuition for the following month!
<P>&nbsp;</P>
That's right, when a new student enrolls with us, if they mention that it was your referral that brought them to our dojo, you will receive half off of your next months tuition. It's just that easy!
<P>&nbsp;</P>
Get two friends to sign up, and you'll get entire follwing month for <B>free</B>!<BR>
Heck, just get 24 friends to enroll and you'll get your entire year for <B>free</B>!!!</P>
