<H1>Constructive and Counterproductive Use of Resistance in Aikido Training</H1></DIV>
<DIV>
<P>The four levels of training in Aikido were presented in 
a previous Dragon Times article (vol. 5, p. 31).  These levels are:</P>
<OL class=a>
<LI>KATAI (rigid)
<LI>YAWARAKAI (resilient)
<LI>KI-NO-NAGARE (flowing)
<LI>KI (spirit)
</LI></OL>
<P>Aikido is generally associated with KI-NO-NAGARE 
technique, and some persons train this way exclusively in an 
almost dance-like manner.  I personally consider it unfortunate 
that a widespread public conception of Aikido is based on this 
image.</P>
<P>To quote a passage from a book written my teacher, 
Morihiro Saito Sensei (9-dan), entitled Traditional Aikido Vol. 
5, p. 36, Aikido is generally believed to represent circular 
movements.  Contrary to such belief, however, Aikido, in its true 
Ki form, is a fierce art piercing straight through the center of 
opposition.</P>
<P>It is vitally important to establish a solid foundation in 
KATAI technique before moving on to KI-NO-NAGARE, and 
to continue training KATAI to prevent losing touch with the 
basics.  A person who is proficient in KATAI can easily learn 
KI-NO-NAGARE, but a person who has trained only 
KI-NO-NAGARE will often not be able to move at all if gripped 
strongly.  KATAI training is what tunes a trainee into the reality 
of physical strength and how to overcome it under the worst 
possible conditions.</P>
<P>It is often said that Aikido techniques do not require 
muscular strength to perform, and that it is not harmonious to 
resist a training partner who is attempting to perform a 
technique.  Although there is some truth to this statement, it is 
based on an incomplete understanding of the nature of physical 
power and resistance.</P>
<P>Beginners in Aikido rely on muscular strength to 
overcome resistance.  This is natural, and should not be 
discouraged because it is all they have at the time.  As trainees 
progress, they become proficient in technique, and less muscular 
strength becomes necessary to overcome resistance.</P>
<P>In parallel, trainees develop KOKYU-RYOKU 
(abdominal breath power) as a direct result of their physical 
training.  KOKYU-RYOKU is much stronger than muscular 
power, and eventually the techniques become almost effortless, 
even against strong resistance.  After a number of years of hard 
and dedicated KATAI training, it becomes true that Aikido 
requires little muscular strength.</P>
<P>After a number of decades, it is possible to enter level 4 (KI) 
which is much stronger than KOKYU-RYOKU.  However, 
beginners should not think about this, because they will only 
become frustrated.</P>
<P>Constructive resistance is not a break of harmony, but on the 
contrary the ultimate in harmony because trainees help each 
other to develop at the fastest possible rate.</P>
<P>Senior trainees are paired with junior trainees in basic 
training.  Senior trainees, with their superior knowledge, are able 
to provide the right amount and direction of resistance so that the 
junior partner must struggle to feel out how to overcome the 
resistance and learn the technique.  Junior trainees are 
encouraged to resist senior partners with everything they have 
(generally pure muscular power), so that the senior trainees can 
hone their technique against full resistance.</P>
<P>Although dance-like movements can be learned 
without resistance, constructive resistance is necessary to learn 
effective technique because without resistance a trainee does not 
know if the technique is really working.  Constructive resistance 
provides the feedback and guidance that are necessary to deal 
effectively with the reality of physical strength.</P>
<P>In basic training, constructive resistance is directly 
against the technique.  At advanced levels, constructive 
resistance can include uninhibited attempts to escape or reverse 
the technique.</P>
<P>Resistance is only constructive if it results in trainees 
growing and improving their technique and spirit.  The level of 
resistance must not be excessive, because trainees will never 
learn techniques if they are prevented from performing them.  
Preventing a trainee from performing a technique is further 
counterproductive in that it defeats self-confidence and 
self-esteem.</P>
<P>The proper level of resistance is such that a trainee is 
able to complete a technique with great difficulty.  This is also 
extremely good physical exercise, straining many muscles of the 
body.  Beginners, however, must sometimes be given negative 
resistance such that they are physically guided to perform the 
proper movements.</P>
<P>Resistance is counterproductive if it is based on 
egotism, or a desire to compete with, humiliate or intimidate a 
training partner.  Under no circumstances should a training 
partner be deliberately injured or subjected to a dangerous 
situation.  The purpose of constructive resistance is to help a 
training partner learn effective technique, and counterproductive 
resistance defeats this purpose.</P>
<P>In summary, Aikido does require little muscular 
strength if it is learned correctly, and resistance is not 
harmonious if it is applied counterproductively.  However, 
muscular power and constructive resistance are vital elements in 
Aikido training, and constitute stepping stones to higher levels.</P>
