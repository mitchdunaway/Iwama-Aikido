In 1919, he turned towards the spiritual, pacifistic teachings of the Omoto religion and started to develop the Art of Peace. In 1942,<BR>
in the midst of the chaos of World War II, O-Sensei named his new martial art <STRONG>Aikido</STRONG>, and moved to the small country town of Iwama.<BR>
There he continued to practice, teach and refine Aikido until he passed away in 1969. </P></TD></TR>

but a close confidant of O-Sensei for the following 23 years. After the founder's death, he was put in charge of the Iwama dojo<BR>
and became the guardian of the Aiki-shrine. Today, he is also known for his books, his clear and structured way of teaching,<BR>
and the organization of the huge number of techniques that comprise <STRONG>Iwama-style Aikido</STRONG>. It is through Saito Sensei's<BR>
timeless Iwama style techniques, that the teacher and students of Austin Iwama Aikido will always remember him.</P></TD></TR>

Field Sensei founded Austin Iwama Aikido in 2010. Field Sensei is a Yondan (fourth degree black belt) with over 20 years of experience<BR>
in Aikido. Field Sensei was trained by <A href="/Alexander_Bio.html">David Alexander</A>, one of the top Iwama Aikido teachers in America, who spent over 10 years<BR>
studying under <A href="/Saito_Bio.html">Morihiro Saito Shihan</A> in Iwama, Japan. After Alexander Sensei’s retirement, Field Sensei became the Technical Director<BR>
of <a href="/index_wva.html">Westlake Village Aikido</a> where he continued to teach until moving to Austin in 2006. Field Sensei has also been fortunate<BR>
enough to study with many of Aikido’s top instructors including Morihiro Saito, Hiroshi Isoyama, Bill Witt, and Robert Koga.<BR>
The Aikido training at Austin Iwama Aikido follows Saito Shihan's traditional Aikido style and teaching methods.
