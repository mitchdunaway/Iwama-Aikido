<P>July 15, 2001 - I've just received a brand new zippy connection today so updates will be back on track. I've added video of Kevin Price's test in the Testing section, and a video of Katatedori Iriminage in the Media section.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>July 10, 2001 - Alexander Sensei will be teaching tomorrow night (Wednesday, July 11th).</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>July 8, 2001 - Congratulations to Kevin Price on passing his 5th kyu exam!</P>
<P>My apologies for the site being rather slow lately. I've had many things to do and no means&nbsp;to post any new video or pictures. This will be changing very shortly. At that time video&nbsp;from Kevin's test will be posted, video of new techniques will be posted, and some of Alexander Sensei's personal pictures from the late 70s and early 80s in Iwama will be posted.</P>
<P>Sensei's article "Budo - The Martial Way" has been formatted.</P>
<P>Finally, please note that there is now a link in the Links section to <A href="http://homestead.juno.com/tabby150/ink5000.html">Scott Cattanach's website</A>. Scott Cattanach is the artist who created the Westlake Village Aikido logo found on the front page of this site.</P></DIV></body>
