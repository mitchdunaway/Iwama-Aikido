      Aikido this year. He began his studying of aikido in 1946. This lead him 
      to be a long time uchi deshi of O-Sensei's for more than 23 years. 
      O-Sensei passed away in 1969 with his head in the hands of Saito Sensei. A 
      long time teacher-student relationship ended.</B> <B>The Iwama dojo and 
      the Aiki Shrine was left in Saito Sensei's care. This and the Aikido the 
      founder taught in Iwama is something Saito Sensei still today is 
      preservering and teaching, not only in Iwama, the birthplace of Aikido, 
      but all over the world. Saito Sensei�s paramount objective is to preserve 
      the Aikido the founder taught and not to change it in any way.</B> <B>In 
      this perspective Saito Sensei is very much unique, since it has been 
      common practise of aikido teachers to develope their own aikido. Saito 
      Sensei has continued teaching the Aikido of the founder and left his mark 
      in the Aikido community through a series of books and videos. Today when 
      Saito Sensei is celebrating his 50 years in Aikido he is also the Dai 
      Sempai at Hombu Dojo.</B></FONT></P>

      Seminar</B></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular>Saito Sensei's 
      50 years in Aikido was celebrated in Denmark, Fugels� with a huge one week 
      seminar. Close to 300 participants showed up, training hard all week. In 
      class you found people from Denmark ,Sweden, England, Ireland, Germany, 
      Holland, Schwitzerland, USA, Japan, Italy, Spain, Brazil, Poland, Holland, 
      France... I almost forgot to mention all the japanese aikidokas who came 
      to the seminar. A very special thank you all for coming is more than 
      required!! Not to forget Hitohiro Saito Sensei who also brought good hope 
      for the future. In the morning there was weapons class, bokken and after a 
      short break another weapons class, this time jo. In the afternoon the 
      taijutsu training began. All in all three classes everyday, not to mention 
      the training sessions in between, made up for a tough but most enjoyable 
      week of Aikido. We have alot to thank Copenhagen Aikido Club for, not the 
      least the excellent orginization. The Sports Center is well situated close 
      to the sea and quite isolated from the outside world. This helps when you 
      want to concentrate on one thing, Aikido. The participants are well taken 
      care off, meals were served in a dining room punctually, and the 
      comfortable sleeping accomodations furnished us with the well deserved 
      rest.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular>During the week 
      in Denmark Saito Sensei gave me the opportunity of an interview. As there 
      has been some questions gathering up for myself regarding the background 
      of Aikido I took the opportunity to find the answers. Today Saito Sensei 
      is one of the few who is a direct link to the founder and also one of the 
      few who can give first hand information on Aikido and it�s 
      background.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular><B>Q: Did Saito 
      Sensei train other forms of Budo prior to your Aikido 
      training?</B></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular><B>A: </B>Yes I 
      did. I did Kendo, Karate and some Judo.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular><B>Q: How come 
      Saito Sensei started training Aikido?</B></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular><B>A:</B> I 
      heard of a mysteriuos man doing an unknown form of Budo close to where I 
      lived. This was in 1946 and I began studying for the founder. When I 
      started with Aikido, we trained really hard. At times we did alot of 
      Suwari waza techniques, even if our knees were bleeding we still carried 
      on training! We did Suwari waza for days and then changed to something 
      else, like ryotedori techniques and did that for days. This was the way 
      the training was conducted in Iwama.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular><B>Q: At the 
      time Saito Sensei started Aikido, were there many other students in the 
      dojo?</B></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular><B>A: </B>Well, 
      there were several students at the time. Tohei, Abe, Tanabe and Shioda 
      were training when I began. Tohei stayed only for a short time and then 
      left due to the fact that he was forming a family. Abe stayed for a year 
      and then left for France. Tanabe stayed there for a short time and so did 
      Shioda, who left to work at a Steel Mill where he started teaching 
      aikido.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular><B>Q: Besides 
      Saito Sensei, who has been Uchi deshi the longest? And for how 
      long?</B></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular><B>A: </B>There 
      were not any other uchi deshis! Especially if you mean long term students 
      who stayed for a year or more. Most of the students stayed not longer than 
      3-6 months.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular><B>Q: Who among 
      the Senseis today have been uchi deshis?</B></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular>A: Well, if you 
      speak of Senseis like; Yamada, Tamura, Tohei, Saotome and Kanai they all 
      are students of Kisshomaru Ueshiba. They never went to Iwama and practised 
      for O-Sensei. Chiba Sensei once stayed in Iwama for 3 months.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular><B>Q: Who 
      taught in Iwama and in Tokyo when O-Sensei was not there?</B></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular><B>A: </B>When 
      O-Sensei was not in Iwama, I was in charge of the teaching. I do not know 
      who taught in Hombu dojo when O-Sensei was not there for obvious reasons, 
      I was in Iwama. I rarely went to Hombu dojo. During 1960-61 O-Sensei was 
      very vital. He then sometimes went to Tokyo to teach Aikido, though not 
      many days would pass before students of the Hombu Dojo called me asking me 
      to take O-Sensei home! O-Sensei was giving them a hard time, scolding them 
      for not practising the correct way.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular>In Iwama 
      O-Sensei used to do his own practise in the mornings and then I was the 
      only student to take part. In return for his special teaching I worked in 
      O-Sensei�s farm.</FONT></P>
      <P></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular><B><IMG 
      height=297 hspace=10 
      src="images/saitow22.jpeg" 
      width=220 align=left vspace=10>Q: Where did O-Sensei spend most of his 
      time teaching, in Iwama or in Tokyo? And how did this change in the 
      40-ies, 50-ies and 60-ies?</B></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular><B>A:</B> First 
      of all I want to make it clear that O-Sensei was an Iwama person. That is 
      where he wanted to spend his time. During the 40-ies and 50-ies he spent 
      almost all of his time in Iwama, he sometimes went to Tokyo. O-Sensei went 
      more often to Tokyo in the 60-ies, then perhaps the ratio was a 50-50 
      split between Iwama and Tokyo. Though when O-Sensei got sick in Tokyo, he 
      himself would call me asking me to take him home.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular>There was a 
      difference in what O-Sensei taught in different places. O-Sensei did not 
      teach the weapons in Hombu Dojo! The concept of Riai (the relation between 
      the weapons and taijutsu) was not taught in Hombu Dojo, only talked about. 
      O-Sensei only taught the weapons and the concept of Riai in 
      Iwama.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular>O-Sensei 
      trained and studied really hard in Iwama. The developement took place in 
      Iwama over a period of 15-20 years. The developement started in 1945 and 
      finished some time between 1960-65. Aikido was developed during this Iwama 
      period.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular>I wish to say 
      some words about all the lies about O-Sensei and his aikido. For instance 
      the lie that there is not any weapons in Aikido; this really makes me 
      angry! I want the truth to be known about the background of Aikido. 
      Please, make sure this will be put out on the Internet! I am particularly 
      angry about that Hombu Dojo is trying to hide the fact that O-Sensei was 
      an Iwama person and that it was during his time in Iwama Aikido was 
      developed.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular><B>Here the 
      interview ended. I say my thanks to Saito Sensei for an enlightening 
      interview.</B><BR>Mats
