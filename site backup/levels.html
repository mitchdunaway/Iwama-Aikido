<H1>Levels of Technique in Aikido Training</H1></DIV>
<DIV>
<P>There are four levels of technique in Aikido training.</P>
<OL class=a>
<LI>KATAI (rigid)
<LI>YAWARAKAI (flexible)
<LI>KI-NO-NAGARE (flowing)
<LI>KI (spirit)
</LI></OL>
<P>KATAI training is also known as KIHON (basic), and 
is what builds the foundation of TAI-SABAKI (body movement) 
and KOKYU-RYOKU (abdominal breath power).  Training is 
done with a partner, where one person acts as the attacker and 
the other as the defender, with the roles being reversed after each 
repetition.</P>
<P>In KATAI training, the attacker establishes a strong 
grip on the defender's wrist, shoulder or other part of the body.  
The defender does not attempt to evade the attack, but allows the 
attacker to attain the initial advantage.</P>
<P>From this situation, the defender must perform a 
technique to escape from the attacker's grip and take control.  
The technique must be done accurately, or the defender will not 
be not be able to escape.</P>
<P>The principle of AWASE in Aikido is to merge into an 
attacker's movement and take control.  It is hardest to do using 
KATAI technique, and for this reason KATAI is the premiere 
method for learning strong technique in the shortest possible 
time.  It is training to the hilt, because the defender is dealing 
with the attacker's full power, and any mistake will result in 
immediately obvious ineffectiveness.</P>
<P>YAWARAKAI technique is intermediate between 
KATAI and KI-NO-NAGARE.  The principle is similar to that 
of JUDO, and the chinese character for YAWARAKAI is the 
same as the JU in JUDO.  It comes into play where a defender 
attempts to perform a KATAI technique, but is overpowered by 
the attacker.  In this case, the defender gives in resiliently (like 
bamboo in the wind), but deflects the attack in a direction such 
that he can merge into the movement and take control.</P>
<P>In KI-NO-NAGARE technique, the defender does not 
wait for the attacker to obtain a grip, but begins merging into the 
attacker's movement before contact is made.  KI-NO-NAGARE 
is actually most practical for self-defense, and is also known as 
"leading KI".  Aikido is most known for this level of technique.</P>
<P>It is vitally important to establish a solid foundation in 
KATAI technique before moving on to KI-NO-NAGARE, and 
to continue training KATAI to prevent losing touch with the 
basics.  A person who is proficient in KATAI can easily learn 
KI-NO-NAGARE, but a person who has trained only 
KI-NO-NAGARE will often not be able to move at all if gripped 
strongly.  KATAI training is what tunes a trainee into the reality 
of physical strength and how to overcome it under the worst 
possible conditions.</P>
<P>KI is the ultimate of Aikido technique.  The defender 
establishes a link of KI with the defender and merges into the 
defender's power on a spiritual level.</P>
<P>KI technique can be achieved only after many decades 
of hard KATAI training.  As the founder of Aikido, O-Sensei 
Morihei Uyeshiba, once stated, "I am what I am today only 
because I did KATAI training for 50 years".</P>
<P>O-Sensei lived in KI during the latter part of his life.  
Although many try to imitate O-Sensei's KI technique, few if any 
have succeeded in achieving anything remotely comparable.  KI 
technique is something that beginners should know is possible, 
but will only frustrate themselves if they try to do it.</P>
<P>Real KI technique is not a series of exercises based on 
the power of suggestion, but something profound that comes 
from tapping into KI.  It can be very gentle, as is generally 
associated with O-sensei in his latter years or, as Morihiro 
Saito-Sensei describes in his book "Traditional Aikido Vol. 5", 
on page 36, "Aikido is generally believed to represent circular 
movements.  Contrary to such belief, however, Aikido, in its true 
KI form, is a fierce art piercing straight through the center of 
opposition".</P>
<P>In summary, new trainees should concentrate on 
learning the basics through KATAI training.  By doing this, they 
will establish a solid foundation for the higher levels of 
technique.</P>
