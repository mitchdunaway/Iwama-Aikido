<P><b>October 19th, 2009</b> - Tonight is your last night to beat up on Field Sensei before he heads back to Texas.  Be there.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><b>October 16th, 2009</b> - <i>Assault a Former Teacher Night</i> was a blast.  We had a great turnout and a fantastic work out to match.  Field Sensei will very likely be in attendance this evening as well as Monday (October 19th) evening if you would like to beat on him further.<br>
Pictures will be posted shortly after Field Sensei returns to Austin.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><b>October 8th, 2009</b> - We have confirmation that at least three other black belts, in addition to Field Sensei, will be attending <i>Assault a Former Teacher Night</i> on October 14th. Don't miss out on all the fun.  Be sure to show up to class next Wednesday!</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><b>October 5th, 2009</b> - Come join us on Wednesday, October 14th for <i>Assault a Former Teacher Night</i> at Westlake Village Aikido.<br>
Christopher S. Field, former WVA instructor, will be here for class that evening and he wants to train with YOU!  Come see how old and tired he's become.  Will he even remember how to Tae No Henko?  You'll be able to tell all your friends that you beat up a 4th Dan Aikido instructor.  Really, it's a night of fun for the whole family.<br>
As a bonus, Chris is going to hoping to bring other surprise yudansha from years past so you can dish out additional pain to them as well.<br>
Don't miss this exciting event!</P>
