<P><B>August 30, 2002 - </B>I have posted information about a new seminar with Hitohiro Saito Sensei on the Seminars page.  Also, remember that there is a Saito Shihan Mermorial Seminar (featuring David Alexander among others) in just a couple of weeks (September 14th in Rohnert Park).</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>August 27, 2002 - </B><U>CORRECTION</U> Alexander Sensei will not be teaching tonight. He will try to make it tomorrow evening.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>August 17, 2002 - </B>The <A href="iwamawisdom.html">Iwama Monogatari</A> section has been rearranged in (more or less) chronilogical order.  When new stories are written, I will post the update here and you can search for the new title.  For instance:<BR>
I have also added a new Iwama story called "The Visitor" to the <A href="iwamawisdom.html">Iwama Monogatari</A> section.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>August 16, 2002 - </B>Five new stories from Iwama have been added to the <A href="iwamawisdom.html">Iwama Monogatari</A> section.  All of them are very good and give a realistic account of what it was like to train in Iwama in the early 70s.  A few pictures have been added as well.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>August 14, 2002 - </B>Alexander Sensei has written more stories for the <A href="iwamawisdom.html">Iwama Monogatari</A> (Tales from Iwama) section, including a story about his first experience in Iwama.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>August 13, 2002 - </B>Alexander Sensei has agreed to write some content for this website. His writings will consist of what it was like to train in Iwama in the 1970s, and other anecdotes he remembers from his long Aikido career.  These writings will be available for viewing exclusively on this website (and occasionally on www.saitosensei.com).<BR>
I am calling the section "<A href="iwamawisdom.html">Iwama Monogatari</A>" (Tales from Iwama).  You can find this section in the menu on the left of your screen.  It will be updated whenever Alexander Sensei is inspired.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>August 11, 2002 - </B>Another copy of Saito Sensei's Traditional Aikido Volume 3 is available on eBay.  You can find it <A href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=1555408810">here</A>.  Westlake Village Aikido does not vouch for the quality of the seller, only the book itself.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>August 1, 2002 - </B>Alexander Sensei will most likely be teaching next Wednesday, August 7th.<BR>
I have added a link on the Links page to a site which is a tribute to Saito Sensei.  It is an extremely well done site.  Patricia Yarrow has done an exceptional job of putting it together!  Click <A href="http://www.well.com/user/pyarrow/saito/index.html">here</A> to go there now.</P>
