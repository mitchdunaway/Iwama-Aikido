  <h2>Iwama</h2>
</div>
<div>
<p>
  For over 45 years, the small town of Iwama has been a mecca for those wishing to understand and practice Aikido.
  Aikido students from all over the world have come to train and receive the teaching of Saito Sensei.
  While some visit for just a few days, others, like David Alexander, have lived and practiced there for months to years.
  Though the faces have continually changed, one thing has remained the same: the spirit of Aikido.
  Aikido is often referred to as the &quot;Gentle Art.&quot; There is truth to this, but it can be misleading to those who have not
  experienced actual Aikido training. While the beautiful flowing movements of Aikido appear to be non-violent, even passive,
  they can actually be hard, vigorous, and dynamic, with powerful wristlocks and direct strikes. The term gentle refers to
  the spirit and intent of the art, as well as to its form and to its true students; it does not refer to the rigors of
  training or to the effectiveness of its techniques. The intent of Aikido, in its marital or budo aspect, is to subdue an
  attacker quickly and efficiently while causing the least amount of harm in the process. Morihei Ueshiba (Oo-Sensei) developed
  Aikido by synthesizing what he had learned over a lifetime of practicing and using a variety of traditional marital arts.
  He emphasized that the main principle of Aikido is harmony, and it is for this reason that Aikido is neither offensive,
  defensive, hard, nor soft; it is all of these things. Further, Aikido is not only a martial art, it is a philosophy and a
  way of life as well. The ai () in Aikido () means harmony or synthesis; ki () means spirit, energy, or life force;
  and do () means way or path. Aikido, therefore, means the way or path of harmonizing spirit or energy. One man who follows
  this path and who personifies this spirit is Saito Sensei, a man who has dedicated his life to the study and teaching of Aikido.
  Saito Sensei studied with Morihei Ueshiba, the founder of Aikido,for over 20 years in Iwama, and now, after 45 years of Aikido,
  Saito Sensei still teaches everyday. In addition to teaching and spreading Aikido in Japan, Saito Sensei has been teaching
  internationally for 20 years, and many of his students have themselves gone on to become teachers of Aikido throughout the world.

  Iwama is a small
  country village a set in a quiet farming area about 1 hour and 30 mins train
  ride north-east of Tokyo on the Mito line. It is famous in the Aikido world
  for being the home the Aiki-jinja (the Aikido shrine), and the Iwama Dojo,
  which served as a home to O-Sensei when he moved from Tokyo to the country
  in 1942. Apparently it was a dream of O-Sensei to lead a relaxed and healthy
  country life, mixing farming with Martial Arts training. Here he was able
  to develop his ideas into the art we know today. The Iwama Dojo is one
  of the few remaining traditional &quot;old style&quot; training centres in Japan.
  It is set in roughly 17 acres of beautiful oak forest and remains practically
  the same as it was 50 years ago.

  The Dojo is small; only a 50
  mat floor space, yet people from all over the world come to train with
  Saito Sensei, and experience the tough life and vigorous training needed
  to temper the Martial Spirit
</p>
<p>
Training is twice a day,
morning and evening, Monday to Saturday. Students can live at the Dojo
as &quot;Uchi-deshi&quot;, (inside students), or as the locals and the longer term
foreigners usually do, train as &quot;Soto-deshi&quot; (outside students). The uchi
deshi cook their own meals, do the chores around the Dojo and immerse themselves
in the training life of traditional Budo, by receiving the favoured teaching
of Saito Sensei. Extra training is also undertaken when University groups
come to Iwama for special intensive periods, so students could be training
anything up to 4- hours a day. Training is tough, and discipline is strict;
students are expected to conform to the traditional Japanese way, this
not only develops great inner strength, but also builds solid character.More
importantly, students who have spent time at Iwama exhibit a strength and
sharpness of technique that is characteristic of such intense study, and
develop into teachers of the highest calibre.

  The Aikido shrine, which occupies
  a plot of land on the other side of the road to the dojo, was actually
  completed before the dojo, in 1944. It was built to O-Sensei's plan based
  on principles of Kotodama, utilising it's component forms; the triangle,
  circle and square. It enshrines 43 deities, to whom O-Sensei prayed almost
  every day. In 1962, a Ceremonial Hall in front of the shrine was completed,
  and that is what the visitor sees today. Since O-Sensei's passing in 1969,
  both the Shrine and the Dojo have been left in the care of Saito Sensei.
  Regular Ceremonies are held at the Shrine, with the present Doshu and visitors
  from Tokyo coming to join in rememberence of O-Sensei and other important
  Shinto dates.
</p>
<p>
  The small structure to the
  left is a natural spring, which produces cool and fresh water. Students
  claim that the taste of the water is different from day to day. Weapons
  classes are often conducted on the grounds in front of the hall.

<p>
  Morihiro Saito Sensei, 9th
  Dan, is the longest serving student of O-Sensei, having trained with him
  for 23 years, and has been the head of the Iwama dojo since O-Sensei's
  passing. Since then, Aikido has grown in popularity, and students from
  around the world come to Iwama to train with Saito Sensei and experience
  the life of traditional Martial Arts training.
</p>
<p>
  Saito Sensei, now 70, has
  been training Aikido for more than 50 years, and is regarded as the world's
  technical expert on Aikido. He is the author of a highly acclaimed series
  of reference training manuals, and travels around the world conducting
  seminars.

<p>
  Saito Sensei
  was born near Iwama, and was a railway worker for many of his earlier years.
  He originally came from a karate background, and had done some kendo, as
  so many Aikido practioners do. In those early years, Saito Sensei was famous
  for his strength and vigorous training method. Stories of him travelling
  to Tokyo and picking fights with gangsters, to test the Aikido techniques
  he learnt are told in the same breath as praise for his ability as a teacher
  providing clear, systematic and easy to understand instruction.
</p>
<p>
  Now that Saito Sensei is
  in his 70's, it is evident that his Aikido has changed, yet older students
  at the seminars still report that his throws &quot;still have that power&quot;, and
  his footwork is just as fast and precise as ever.
</p>
<p>
  Saito Sensei appreciates
  that he will not be in this world forever, and so has asked many of his
  top students, who are now instructors with their own dojo around the world,
  to be active in preserving the Martial Art of O-Sensei. At the most recent
  seminar in Sydney, he spoke of some who believe weapons are not necessary
  in Aikido, and others who have begun to change the art to suit their own
  means. Saito Sensei believes that what O-Sensei left the world is a valuable
  legacy, and would like to see it preserved for future generations.
</p>
<p>
This is the undertaking of
the Takemusu Aiki Association.

<h2>Shinto Shrine on Atago Mountain</h2>
<p><img src="images/otagojinja.gif" height="205" width="320" alt="Shinto Shrine" /></p>
<p>
  Iwama is situated at the
  foot of Atago Mountain, which commands an impressive view of the surrounding
  countryside. On occassions, the Aikido deshi would run through town and
  up the several hundred metres of road to the top of the mountain, where
  there is a Shinto Shrine, and priests quarters. Here, in the grounds before
  the shrine, weapons classes are sometimes held, and it is the backdrop
  for the cover and several of the outdoor photos in Saito Sensei's first
  volume of the Traditional Aikido series. The shrine is dedicated to the
  local fire god, a powerful deity of Shinto belief. Homage and sacrifice
  is made to pacify the deity with the hope of preventing bushfires in the
  neighboring region, which relies on farming and agriculture for it's prosperity.
</p>
<p>
  Atago Mountain is also famous
  in the Zen tradition, for it was here that the Zen priest Takuan rode a
  horse up and down the shrine's stone steps to demonstrate to his friend
  Lord Yagyu Tajima no kami the Zen principles of mental obscurities blocking
  physical action. Lord Yagyu, upon remembering the famous horseman Magaki
  Heikuro riding up and down the stairs at Atago on horseback, was unable
  to perform the feat himself. Takuan rode the stairs easily, saying &quot;there
  is no horseman on horseback, nor horse under the saddle.&quot;
