There's a great auction on eBay for a full set of Saito Sensei's original Traditional Aikido books.  These books are the best available on the subject and come highly recommended!  As always, Westlake Village Aikido is not endorsing the seller, just the quality of the product.  Click <A href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=2907069952&category=11447">here</A> to see the auction.</P>
