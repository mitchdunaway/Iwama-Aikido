<P><B>May 31, 2002 - </B>I added a link to Traditional Aikido Iwama Ryu Great Britain. This replaces the dead link to Aikido of Sonoma.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>May 30, 2002 - </B>I gave Alexander Sensei his own Video page in the Media section. This should make the extensive Video page load faster. I also added a link to the Media section to the News navigation bar on the left.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>May 29, 2002 - </B>A page with information about training Aikido for free has been added. You can find that <A href="free.html">here</A>.<BR>
I also added video of the first five Jo Suburi, Ryotedori Iriminage, and an alternate angle for Yokomenuchi Shihonage. They are all viewable in the Media section.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>May 27, 2002 - </B>There will be class this evening despite the Mermorial Day holiday. See you there...<BR>
I added a few videos today. They're all up on the Video page in the Media section. The only completely new one is Morotedori Nikkyo. The others are larger versions of existing video: Katatedori Nikkyo Omote, Ryotedori Ikkyo Omote, Ryotedori Shihonage Omote, Shomenuchi Nikkyo Omote and Ura, Shomenuchi Sankyo Omote and Ura, Shomenuchi Shihonage Omote, Yokomenuchi Ikkyo Omote and Ura, and Yokomenuchi Shihonage Omote.<BR>
I also added a video of David Sunderland's 2nd kyu jiyu waza. That video is up in the Testing section.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>May 17, 2002 - </B>Alexander Sensei has given me permission to post photos from his seminar in Sweden. They are now available for viewing in the Media section, under Seminar Images.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>May 13, 2002 - </B>A message from Alexander Sensei...<BR>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<I>Dear Aikido students -<BR>
As some of you already know, Morihiro Saito-Sensei, my teacher and mentor, passed away last Sunday.<BR>
I will be at class this Wednesday and lead a prayer at the end.  We will schedule a gathering to celebrate his spirit at a future time.<BR>
Hope you can make it.<BR>
Dave.</I></P>
