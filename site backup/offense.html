<H1>Offensive Technique in Aikido</H1></DIV>
<DIV>
<H2>Introduction</H2>
<P>The general perception of Aikido is that it is a purely 
defensive martial art, and that there are no offensive techniques.  
In fact, Aikido is not so limited.</P>
<P>As described in a previous article in Dragon Times, 
there are four levels of technique in Aikido:</P>
<OL class=a>
<LI>KATAI (rigid)
<LI>YAWARAKAI (resilient)
<LI>KI-NO-NAGARE (flowing)
<LI>KI (spirit)
</LI></OL>
<P>Level 1 is where most training should take place.  
The practice consists of a first training partner attacking a second 
training partner with a grip or strike, and the second partner 
performing a technique to neutralize the attack.  The roles are 
then reversed, with the partners taking turns being the attacker 
and defender.  In this form of training, the attacker is allowed to 
get a rigid grip on the defender before the defender begins the 
defensive technique.  This is training to the hilt, because the 
defender must overcome the entire power of the attacker, who 
knows in advance which technique the defender is going to use.</P>
<P>Level 3 is similar to level 1, but the defender does not 
wait until the attacker gets a strong grip.  Instead, the defender 
starts moving into the defensive technique as the attacker is in 
the process of gripping.  This form of technique is flowing in that 
the attacker is led forward by his own determination to secure the 
grip.</P>
<P>Level 2 can be considered a transition between levels 1 
and 3.  In level 2, the defender is overwhelmed by the attacker's 
power and gives in resiliently like bamboo bending in the wind.</P>
<P>In all three of these levels, the defender merges into the 
attacker's power and takes control, more specifically 
transforming the original attacking movement into a new 
movement which results in the attacker being thrown or pinned.  
This the principle of AIKI, known in Japanese as AWASE 
(coming together) or KI NO MUSUBI (link of spirit).</P>
<P>Levels 1 to 3 are the basic training in Aikido, and can 
be compared to learning the alphabet and basic grammar of a 
language.  The defensive part of the training is generally static, 
as the defender waits for a physical attack before initiating a 
defense.</P>
<P>Level 4 is where the defender's spirit and the attacker's 
spirit are one, and the defender is able to sense and control all 
movements of the attacker.  In the words of Aikido founder 
O-Sensei Morihei Uyeshiba, "All I have to do is stand with my 
back facing the opponent.  If the opponent tries to strike at me, 
his will to strike will hit and hurt himself.  I am integrated with 
the universe, I possess nothing.  When I stand up, I absorb my 
opponent."</P>
<P>Although level 4 is the ultimate in Aikido, it is very 
hard to attain, and to the best of my knowledge only O-Sensei 
and perhaps a very few others have reached it.  The rest of us 
should not think about it, and train diligently in levels 1 to 3 to 
improve ourselves little by little, one day at a time.<P>
<H2>An Exemplary Gateway</H2>
<P>SHOMEN-UCHI IKKYO is one of the most basic 
techniques in Aikido.  It consists of gripping an attacker's arm 
with both hands and pinning him face down.  This technique can, 
and is in a number of schools, performed in response to a straight 
overhead strike (SHOMEN-UCHI).  As such, the scenario is 
static defense as presented above.</P>
<P>However, O-Sensei and my teacher Morihiro Saito do 
not perform the technique this way.  As taught by O-Sensei 
"Step out on your right foot and strike directly at your opponent's 
face with your right TEGATANA (handblade) and punch his 
ribs with your left fist." Budo, Teachings of the Founder of 
Aikido, translation by John Stevens, Kodansha America, Inc. 
1991, page 41.  Saito-Sensei teaches "The basic rule calls for 
your initiating a strike of your own prior to your partner's and 
grabbing his hand has he tries to parry your blow.  By taking the 
initiative you will be leading the hand of your partner out into 
your own sphere of action." Aikido, Volume III, by Morihiro 
Saito, Minato Research & Publishing Co., Ltd., 1974, page 40.</P>
<P>This concept is not static defense.  The defender 
initiates the engagement with a strike to the attacker's face.  The 
attacker then has two choices; do nothing and get hit, or raise his arm 
in front of his face to block the strike.  This latter movement is 
what is desired, and places the attacker's arm in the proper 
position for an IKKYO pinning grip.  In other words, the 
defender calls out the attacker by inducing him to move in a 
desired way, and then merges into this movement and takes 
control in accordance with the principle of AIKI.</P>
<P>It is highly relevant that one of the most basic 
techniques in Aikido, as taught by the founder and his most 
long-time student, begins with an offensive strike.  
SHOMEN-UCHI IKKYO is not an isolated example.  This is 
downplayed in basic training, but demonstrates clearly that the 
roots of Aikido run much deeper than static defense.</P>
<H2>Reality</H2>
<P>Aikido is a martial art that is especially concerned with 
self-defense.  The first premise of self-defense is to walk away 
from a violent or potentially violent engagement as intact as 
possible.  The main tools of self-defense are awareness and 
avoidance.  If these tools fail and a person is physically attacked 
by a violent individual or group, the situation can be extremely 
dangerous and potentially lethal.</P>
<P>Physical self-defense techniques should never be 
limited to static defense.  Especially in the case of an 
engagement involving multiple attackers who may be armed 
with deadly weapons, the odds are strongly in favor of the 
attackers.  The difference between life and death can depend on a 
defender's ability to reduce the odds by preempting an initial 
attack.</P>
<H2>Conclusion</H2>
<P>Although basic Aikido training consists of static 
defense, the gateway to offensive application of technique is in 
plain sight and leads to another dimension of the art.  Offensive 
technique should never, of course, be used to commit 
unprovoked attacks on innocent people.  However, in some 
situations the only potentially successful defense is a strong 
offense, and the scope of Aikido fortunately provides this 
capability.</P>
