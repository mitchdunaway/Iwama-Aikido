After numerous trips from Tokyo to Iwama to train with Saito-sensei, he moved to Iwama in the winter of 1972. There he trained at the Ibaraki Dojo with Saito-sensei for approximately 10 years between 1972 and 1984, and was promoted to shodan (1st degree black belt) in 1973.  While in Iwama he trained with many people from all over the world, including numerous university and military groups, as well as the Iwama locals.</P>
