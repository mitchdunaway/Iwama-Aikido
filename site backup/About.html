				INTRODUCTION
			</h2>
			<P>
			Aikido is a Japanese Martial art developed by Morihei Ueshiba, referred to by 
			Aikidoka as O-Sensei. 
			<P>
			On the surface, it appears to be an art involving pins and throws that were 
			evolved from jiu-jitsu as well as kenjutsu, jojutsu and other arts. Aikido does 
			not focus on blocking, punching and kicking. Instead, the emphasis is on
			uniting 
			your efforts with the attacker to control the situation. It is not a static art 
			but places a great deal of emphasis on the dynamics of movement. Upon deeper 
			examination, you may find self-dense, peace of mind, physical fitness or
			greater 
			teachings. 
			<P>
			Aikido can be translated as follows: Ai means Unite or Combine, Ki is the 
			Energy inherent in any object or being, and Do means Way or Path, resulting in
			a 
			translation of "Combine Energy Way". Some place more emphasis on different 
			components to greater or lesser degrees. It is important to remember that
			Aikido 
			is a Budo, where Bu is often translated as War but literally means Stop Spear 
			and Do means Way resulting in a translation of "Stop Spear Way". It may seem 
			paradoxical for a martial art to strive for peace, but it is an essential 
			understanding to any martial art. 
			<P>
			But you can't learn it by reading about it. In fact, it may do more harm than 
			good. We could attempt to pigeonhole Aikido into a synopsis in a finite number 
			of words, but that would not do it justice, so we leave the practitioner of 
			Aikido to find out what Aikido is for themselves without any preconceived 
			notions. 
			<P>
			So practice, and remember that it is a Gentle Art (as you get thrown to the 
			ground with a resounding thud.)

				HISTORY

				<A name=Historya>History of Aikido</A>
			</H2>
			<P>
			Aikido's founder, Morihei Ueshiba, was born in Japan on December 14, 1883. As 
			a boy, he often saw local thugs beat up his father for political reasons. He
			set 
			out to make himself strong so that he could take revenge. He devoted himself to 
			hard physical conditioning and eventually to the practice of martial arts, 
			receiving certificates of mastery in several styles of jujitsu, fencing, and 
			spear fighting. In spite of his impressive physical and martial capabilities, 
			however, he felt very dissatisfied. He began delving into religions in hopes of 
			finding a deeper significance to life, all the while continuing to pursue his 
			studies of budo, or the martial arts. By combining his martial training with
			his 
			religious and political ideologies, he created the modern martial art of
			Aikido. 
			O-Sensei decided on the name "Aikido" in 1942 (before that he called his
			martial 
			art "aikibudo" and "aikinomichi"). 
			<P>
			Aikido is rooted in several styles of jujitsu (from which modern judo is also 
			derived), in particular Daito-ryu-(aiki)jujitsu, as well as sword and spear 
			fighting arts. Oversimplifying somewhat, we may say that Aikido takes the joint 
			locks and throws from jujitsu and combines them with the body movements of
			sword 
			and spear fighting. However, we must also realize that many Aikido techniques 
			are the result of O-Sensei's own innovation. 
			<P>
			O-Sensei was a devotee of one of Japan's so-called "new religions," Omotokyo. 
			Omotokyo was (and is) part neo-shintoism, and part socio-political idealism.
			One 
			goal of Omotokyo has been ecumenical: the unification of all humanity in a 
			single "heavenly kingdom on earth" where all religions would be united under
			the 
			banner of Omotokyo. It is impossible sufficiently to understand many of 
			O-Sensei's writings and sayings without keeping the influence of Omotokyo
			firmly 
			in mind.

			<P>
			Modern Aikido is firmly rooted in the following three Martial Arts: Kito Ryu 
			Jujutsu, Goto-Ha Tagyu Ryu Jujutsu and Daito Ryu Jujutsu. Practitioners of Kito 
			Ryu Jujutsu perform their techniques in full armor or in formal robes 
			representing full armor; techniques are centered upon throwing an opponent to 
			the ground. Dr. Jigoro Kano combined the best elements of Kito Ryu Jujutsu with 
			Tenjin-shinyo to found modern Kodokan Judo. Goto-Ha Yagyu Ryu Jujutsu traces 
			it's origin to Iajutsu or the Art of Sword Drawing. Of all three, Aikido is 
			primarily influenced by Daito Ryu Jujutsu. 
			<P>
			Daito aikijutsu is said to have been founded by Prince Teijun, the sixth son 
			of the Emperor Seiwa (850 - 880 AD.). Through the prince's son, Tsunemoto, it 
			was passed on to succeeding generations of the Minamoto family. By the time the 
			art had reached Shira Saburo Yoshimitsu, the younger brother of Yoshiie 
			Minamoto, it would appear that the foundations of the present Aikido had
			already 
			been laid. Yoshimitsu was apparently a man of exceptional skill and learning.
			He 
			realized that a warrior's hands and wrists, uncovered and unprotected as they 
			were could be especially vulnerable and he therefore developed techniques to be 
			applied against these points. It is believed he called his system Daito Ryu 
			Aikijutsu after his house "Daito Mansion". 
			<P>
			Yoshimitsu's second son, Yoshikiyo, lived in Takeda in the province of Kai, 
			and he eventually became known by this name. Subsequently, the techniques were 
			passed on to successive generations as the secret art of the Takeda house and 
			made known only to members and retainers of the family. In 1574, Taken
			Kunitsugu 
			moved to Aizu and the techniques passed on to his descendants came known to be 
			as Aizu-todome techniques. 
			<P>
			Thereafter the art remained an exclusively samurai practice and was handed 
			down within the family until Japan emerged from isolation into the Meiji period 
			in 1868. At that time Sokaku Takeda, the head of the family, began to tech the 
			art outside the Takeda household, traveling widely throughout Japan and finally 
			settling in Hokkaido. His son, Tokimune Takeda, opened the Daitokan dojo in 
			Abashiri, Hokkaido, and continued to further the development of Aikido as the 
			head of the Daito school. 
			<P>
			The teachings of the Daito Ryu Aikijutsu continue today and Tokimune Takeda 
			is its current headmaster in Japan. The leading exponents of this traditional 
			sect are Kotaro Horikawa, Yukiyoshi Agawa, Takuma Hisa, Hosaku Matsuda, 
			Tomekichi Yamamoto and Richard Kim in the USA. Matsuda trained two other
			leading 
			proponents of aikijutsu. Yoshiji Okuyama and Sachiyuki Oba. Okuyama is the 
			founder of Hakko Ryu Jujutsu, a modern Bujutsu and includes among his many 
			disciples Michiomi Nakano who, as Doshin So is the founder of the Nippon 
			Shorinji Kempo system. 
			<P>
			The most outstanding of Sokaku Takeda's pupils was Morihei Ueshiba (often 
			referred to by his title 'O-Sensei' or 'Great Teacher'). O-Sensei, a man of
			rare 
			ability, brought to the Daito school the skills of other ancient martial art 
			schools and added techniques of his own setting the stage to develop modern 
			Aikido. O-Sensei, prior to studying under Sokaku Takeda, had received 
			certificates from Tokusaburo Tozawa of Kito Ryu Jujutsu and Masakutsu Nakai of 
			Goto-Ha Ryu Jujutsu.

			<P>
			Aikido was founded in Tokyo in 1942 by Morihei Ueshiba (often referred to by 
			his title 'O-Sensei' or 'Great Teacher'). For many years O-Sensei taught and 
			guided the development of his creation from his Dojo in Wakamusu-cho in Tokyo. 
			<P>
			With the death of O-Sensei in 1969 the development of Aikido was continued by 
			his son, Kisshomaru Ueshiba who presides at Hombu Dojo the general headquarters 
			of the International Aikido Federation, representing all the countries of the 
			free world. Through this organization the quality of the art and the black belt 
			ranks have been strictly regulated. 
			<P>
			Aikido was originally developed by one man, O-Sensei. Many students who 
			trained under O-Sensei decided to spread their knowledge of Aikido by opening 
			their own dojos. Due, among other things, to the dynamic nature of Aikido, 
			different students of O-Sensei interpreted his Aikido in different ways. Thus 
			different styles of Aikido were born. The more common are listed here along
			with 
			a brief explanation of what is different about the style. Each style has its
			own 
			strengths and weaknesses, but all are firmly rooted in the basic concepts which 
			make Aikido the unique art that it is. None should be considered superior or 
			inferior to any other, but rather an individual must find a style which best 
			suits him or her. Outside factors such as geographic location may of course 
			limit one's options. 
			<P>
			Aikikai Also known as Hombu (which actually means headquarters). This is 
			'classical' Aikido as taught by the Ueshiba family. Today it is governed by the 
			Aikikai Foundation which is run by O-Sensei's son, Doshu Kisshomaru Ueshiba. 
			There are several different organizations which teach this style of Aikido such 
			as USAF and ASU (in the United States) and BAF (in the United Kingdom). Most of 
			these organizations are part of the IAF (International Aikido Federation). 
			<P>
			Iwama As taught in the town of Iwama by Morihiro Saito, a close student of 
			O-Sensei. Includes an emphasis on the relationship among taijutsu, ken and jo 
			movements. This style of Aikido reflects the art of the Founder as taught 
			approximately between the years of 1946-1955 and the number of techniques is 
			more numerous than those presently taught at the Aikikai Hombu Dojo. 
			<P>
			Yoshinkan Places emphasis on the use of Aikido as a method of self defense 
			and less on the more esoteric and philosophical elements. 
			<P>
			Ki Society Also known as Shin Shin Toitsu Aikido (Aikido with Mind &amp; Body 
			Coordinated), founded in 1971 by Koichi Tohei a 10th Dan student of O-Sensei 
			who, at O-Sensei's request, brought Aikido to the US. in 1953. Ki Society 
			stresses the use of Ki not only in technique but in daily life to remain calm 
			&amp; relaxed in stressful situations. 
			<P>
			Tomiki Tomiki Ryu Aikido was founded by Kenji Tomiki, a high ranking judoka, 
			whom Jigoro Kano (the founder of Judo) sent to Ueshiba to learn Aikido. The 
			primary focus of Tomiki Aikido is kata (forms) that strive to teach and capture 
			the fundamentals of Aikido. Tomiki de-emphasized the concept and importance of 
			Ki, and instead decided to concentrate on the physiological side of Aikido. 
			<P>
			Kokikai A style founded by Shuji Maruyama Sensei. It is a particularly soft 
			style that emphasizes 'minimum effort for maximum effect.'
