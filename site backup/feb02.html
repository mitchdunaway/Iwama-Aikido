<P>February 24, 2002 - The last of the Koga videos and images have been uploaded to the Media section. Be sure to search for the hidden video in the Koga Party section of the Party Images page!<BR>
Many thanks to Koga Sensei for allowing us to post video. We all look forward to having him back in the future!</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>February 22, 2002 - I have added the first videos from the Koga seminar! I have further divided the Media section. You will now find options for Video and Seminar Video. You will find the first Koga videos in the Seminar Video section.<BR>
I have also added photos from the seminar itself. You will find these in the sub-section Seminar Images, in the Media section.<BR>
I still have a little more footage to go through, so expect a few more images and videos next week.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>February 17, 2002 - There will be class on Monday, February 18th. Alexander Sensei will most likely be teaching both Monday and Tuesday classes.<BR>
Steve Glasberg is looking for somebody to attend the Aiki Expo with. This is a large seminar in Las Vegas put on by Aiki Journal. Steve is looking for someone to split the room charge with. There is more info on the Aiki Expo in the Seminars section. If you are interested in going with Steve, contact the <a href="mailto:westlakevillageaikido@hotmail.com">webmaster</a> or Steve directly.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>February 12, 2002 - The images in the Media section have now been divided up. When you go to the Media section you will see the Images section, which contains photos from seminars, private collections, and other miscellaneous items. Then there are Party Images. This section is devoted to photos from many of the fun parties thrown by Westlake Village Aikido.<BR>
There is one group Koga seminar photo in the Images section (the photo seen above). I've also added a handful of photos from the Koga party. These are the the Party Images section.<BR>
There are many more images coming from the Koga seminar. Check back later this week for more. Also, keep your eyes open for the Koga video clips, and one VERY interesting party clip.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>February 11, 2002 - A tremendous thanks to Koga Sensei for the spectacular seminar he ran for us this past weekend! I know that everybody involved had a very fun time and learned a great deal. We can't wait to have him back again.<BR>
Two group shots have been posted in the Media section. More photos will follow every day until I have enough time to get them all up. Also, Koga Sensei has given me permission to post a few select video clips from the seminar. Check back later this week to get a look at those.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>February 9, 2002 - The first day of the Koga seminar has gone fantastically well!  I look forward to seeing everybody tomorrow and at the party tonight. Pictures, and possibly video, will be posted in a few days.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>February 7, 2002 - I ran across some old promotional photos of Casey Rodgers Sensei and Christopher Field Sensei. These were taken at an old dojo of ours by a former student, Doug Barnard.<BR>
Although these photos were intended to be promotional photos, they have never been posted before... I think it was because of my (Chris's) bad hair.<BR>
Go to the Media section to see them!</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>February 3, 2002 - If you are attending the Koga seminar you are welcome to attend the party for Koga Sensei on Saturday. You may view (and therefore download) directions to the party by clicking on this thumbnail...<BR>

<P>February 2, 2002 - A few last minute reminders for those attending the Koga seminar next weekend:<BR>
<b>-</b> You do not need to wear a gi. Koga Sensei trains in sweats and a t-shirt. You may wear your gi if you wish, but no hakama.<BR>
<b>-</b> Show up on time. Class will begin right at 11:30am on Saturday and right at 8:00am on Sunday.<BR>
<b>-</b> Although there is a water fountain in the dojo, it probably wouldn't hurt to have your own bottle of water handy.<BR>
<b>-</b> The Aikido party in Koga Sensei's honor will take place at 6pm after training on Saturday, at Alexander Sensei's house. A form with directions will be posted on this site very soon. Directions will also be available at the dojo.<BR>
<b>-</b> Even though the dojo will be catering the party with some good Bar-B-Q, it is pot luck, so it would be much appreciated if all seminar attendees would bring a drink, snack, or dessert item.<BR>
<b>-</b> Please continue to check this website all week for any last minute information that may arise. If you have any questions, feel free to email the <A href="mailto:westlakevillageaikido@hotmail.com">webmaster</A>.<BR>
Also, in case you missed the post late last month, pictures from the December Aikido Party are up in the Media section.</P>
