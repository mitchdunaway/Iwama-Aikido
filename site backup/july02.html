<P><B>July 28, 2002 - </B>Added information about the Saito Shihan Mermorial Seminar to the Seminars section.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>July 21, 2002 - </B>Alexander Sensei has been kind enough to provide us with three more photos from Iwama in the 70's.  They are available for viewing on the Images page of the Media section.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>July 19, 2002 - </B>Added a new image of an article in Sweden's <A href="http://www.fightermag.com/">Fighter Magazine</A> about Alexander Sensei's 2002 seminar there. This image can be found in both the Images and Seminar Images pages of the Media section.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>July 15, 2002 - </B>Tests will now be run on a very regular basis. On each night of the week, you will get to experience material from different tests. Those of you coming up for your next rank should find this extremely useful.<BR>
Teaching the material on the test is still left to the teacher's discretion.  The teacher may choose to run additional related techniques not found on the test, but the core of the classes will be the testing material.<BR>
The current testing assignments are as follows:<BR>
Monday - 2nd kyu<BR>
Tuesday - 4th kyu<BR>
Wednesday - 3rd kyu<BR>
Thursday - 1st kyu<BR>
Friday - 5th kyu<BR>
When the testing material is completed, the teacher will run whatever he wants until the tests have been finished in the other classes as well. When all the tests have been completed, the instructors will rotate who is teaching what exam, and the cycle will begin again.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>July 3, 2002 - </B> Aikido Journal has posted T.K. Chiba's Mermorial Address for Saito Sensei. It is extremely good. I encourage anybody interested in Saito Sensei or Iwama history to have a look. Click <A href="http://65.119.177.201/cgi-bin/ubb/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic&f=9&t=001323">here</A> to view it.<BR>
Also, for those who may have missed it last month, here is a link to Mark Larson's Saito Sensi tribute, <A href="http://65.119.177.201/cgi-bin/ubb/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic&f=9&t=001308">True to the Way</A>.<BR>
Finally, Alexander Sensei is teaching tonight! All students should show up for this great training session!</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>July 2, 2002 - </B> Alexander Sensei will be teaching Wednesday night this week. Please turn up for both if you're able.<BR>
That copy of Saito Sensei's hard to find Traditional Aikido series is still up on eBay. This is a great chance to get a really hard to find copy of Volume 1 with the original cover style for far less than it's worth. Click <A href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=1546135733">here</A> to view the auction. Westlake Village Aikido does not endorse the quality of the seller, just the quality of the book.<BR>
There is no training on Thursday, July 4th. Classes will resume on Friday, July 5th.</P>
