<h2><a name="History">History of Aikido</a></h2>
<p>
  Aikido's founder, Morihei Ueshiba, was born in Japan on December 14, 1883. As
  a boy, he often saw local thugs beat up his father for political reasons. He set
  out to make himself strong so that he could take revenge. He devoted himself to
  hard physical conditioning and eventually to the practice of martial arts,
  receiving certificates of mastery in several styles of jujitsu, fencing, and
  spear fighting. In spite of his impressive physical and martial capabilities,
  however, he felt very dissatisfied. He began delving into religions in hopes of
  finding a deeper significance to life, all the while continuing to pursue his
  studies of budo, or the martial arts. By combining his martial training wit his
  religious and political ideologies, he created the modern martial art of Aikido.
  O-Sensei decided on the name &quot;Aikido&quot; in 1942 (before that he called his martial
  art &quot;aikibudo&quot; and &quot;aikinomichi&quot;).
</p>
<p>
  Aikido is rooted in several styles of jujitsu (from which modern judo is also
  derived), in particular Daito-ryu-(aiki)jujitsu, as well as sword and spear
  fighting arts. Oversimplifying somewhat, we may say that Aikido takes the joint
  locks and throws from jujitsu and combines them with the body movements of sword
  and spear fighting. However, we must also realize that many Aikido techniques
  are the result of O-Sensei's own innovation.
</p>
<p>
  O-Sensei was a devotee of one of Japan's so-called &quot;new religions,&quot; Omotokyo.
  Omotokyo was (and is) part neo-shintoism, and part socio-political idealism. One 
  goal of Omotokyo has been ecumenical: the unification of all humanity in a
  single &quot;heavenly kingdom on earth&quot; where all religions would be united under the
  banner of Omotokyo. It is impossible sufficiently to understand many of
  O-Sensei's writings and sayings without keeping the influence of Omotokyo firmly
  in mind.
</p>
<h2><a name="Influences">Influences on Aikido</a></h2>
<p>
  Modern Aikido is firmly rooted in the following three Martial Arts: Kito Ryu
  Jujutsu, Goto-Ha Tagyu Ryu Jujutsu and Daito Ryu Jujutsu. Practitioners of Kito
  Ryu Jujutsu perform their techniques in full armor or in formal robes
  representing full armor; techniques are centered upon throwing an opponent to
  the ground. Dr. Jigoro Kano combined the best elements of Kito Ryu Jujutsu with
  Tenjin-shinyo to found modern Kodokan Judo. Goto-Ha Yagyu Ryu Jujutsu traces
  it's origin to Iajutsu or the Art of Sword Drawing. Of all three, Aikido is
  primarily influenced by Daito Ryu Jujutsu.
</p>
<p>
  Daito aikijutsu is said to have been founded by Prince Teijun, the sixth son
  of the Emperor Seiwa (850 - 880 AD.). Through the prince's son, Tsunemoto, it
  was passed on to succeeding generations of the Minamoto family. By the time the
  art had reached Shira Saburo Yoshimitsu, the younger brother of Yoshiie
  Minamoto, it would appear that the foundations of the present Aikido had already
  been laid. Yoshimitsu was apparently a man of exceptional skill and learning. He
  realized that a warrior's hands and wrists, uncovered and unprotected as they
  were could be especially vulnerable and he therefore developed techniques to be
  applied against these points. It is believed he called his system Daito Ryu
  Aikijutsu after his house &quot;Daito Mansion&quot;.
</p>
<p>
  Yoshimitsu's second son, Yoshikiyo, lived in Takeda in the province of Kai,
  and he eventually became known by this name. Subsequently, the techniques were
  passed on to successive generations as the secret art of the Takeda house and
  made known only to members and retainers of the family. In 1574, Taken Kunitsugu
  moved to Aizu and the techniques passed on to his descendants came known to be
  as Aizu-todome techniques.
</p>
<p>
  Thereafter the art remained an exclusively samurai practice and was handed
  down within the family until Japan emerged from isolation into the Meiji period
  in 1868. At that time Sokaku Takeda, the head of the family, began to tech the
  art outside the Takeda household, traveling widely throughout Japan and finally
  settling in Hokkaido. His son, Tokimune Takeda, opened the Daitokan dojo in
  Abashiri, Hokkaido, and continued to further the development of Aikido as the
  head of the Daito school.
</p>
<p>
  The teachings of the Daito Ryu Aikijutsu continue today and Tokimune Takeda
  is its current headmaster in Japan. The leading exponents of this traditional
  sect are Kotaro Horikawa, Yukiyoshi Agawa, Takuma Hisa, Hosaku Matsuda,
  Tomekichi Yamamoto and Richard Kim in the USA. Matsuda trained two other leading
  proponents of aikijutsu. Yoshiji Okuyama and Sachiyuki Oba. Okuyama is the
  founder of Hakko Ryu Jujutsu, a modern Bujutsu and includes among his many
  disciples Michiomi Nakano who, as Doshin So is the founder of the Nippon
  Shorinji Kempo system.
</p>
<p>
  The most outstanding of Sokaku Takeda's pupils was Morihei Ueshiba (often
  referred to by his title 'O-Sensei' or 'Great Teacher'). O-Sensei, a man of rare
  ability, brought to the Daito school the skills of other ancient martial art
  schools and added techniques of his own setting the stage to develop modern
  Aikido. O-Sensei, prior to studying under Sokaku Takeda, had received
  certificates from Tokusaburo Tozawa of Kito Ryu Jujutsu and Masakutsu Nakai of
  Goto-Ha Ryu Jujutsu.
</p>
<h2><a name="modern">Modern Aikido</a></h2>
<p>
  Aikido was founded in Tokyo in 1942 by Morihei Ueshiba (often referred to by
  his title 'O-Sensei' or 'Great Teacher'). For many years O-Sensei taught and
  guided the development of his creation from his Dojo in Wakamusu-cho in Tokyo.
</p>
<p>
  With the death of O-Sensei in 1969 the development of Aikido was continued by
  his son, Kisshomaru Ueshiba who presides at Hombu Dojo the general headquarters
  of the International Aikido Federation, representing all the countries of the
  free world. Through this organization the quality of the art and the black belt
  ranks have been strictly regulated.
</p>
<p>
  Aikido was originally developed by one man, O-Sensei. Many students who
  trained under O-Sensei decided to spread their knowledge of Aikido by opening
  their own dojos. Due, among other things, to the dynamic nature of Aikido,
  different students of O-Sensei interpreted his Aikido in different ways. Thus
  different styles of Aikido were born. The more common are listed here along with
  a brief explanation of what is different about the style. Each style has its own
  strengths and weaknesses, but all are firmly rooted in the basic concepts which
  make Aikido the unique art that it is. None should be considered superior or
  inferior to any other, but rather an individual must find a style which best
  suits him or her. Outside factors such as geographic location may of course
  limit one's options.
</p>
<p>
  Aikikai Also known as Hombu (which actually means headquarters). This is
  'classical' Aikido as taught by the Ueshiba family. Today it is governed by the
  Aikikai Foundation which is run by O-Sensei's son, Doshu Kisshomaru Ueshiba.
  There are several different organizations which teach this style of Aikido such
  as USAF and ASU (in the United States) and BAF (in the United Kingdom). Most of
  these organizations are part of the IAF (International Aikido Federation).
</p>
<p>
  Iwama as taught in the town of Iwama by Morihiro Saito, a close student of
  O-Sensei. Includes an emphasis on the relationship among taijutsu, ken and jo
  movements. This style of Aikido reflects the art of the Founder as taught
  approximately between the years of 1946-1955 and the number of techniques is
  more numerous than those presently taught at the Aikikai Hombu Dojo.
</p>
<p>
  Yoshinkan Places emphasis on the use of Aikido as a method of self defense
  and less on the more esoteric and philosophical elements.
</p>
<p>
  Ki Society also known as Shin Shin Toitsu Aikido (Aikido with Mind &amp; Body
  Coordinated), founded in 1971 by Koichi Tohei a 10th Dan student of O-Sensei
  who, at O-Sensei's request, brought Aikido to the US. in 1953. Ki Society
  stresses the use of Ki not only in technique but in daily life to remain calm
  &amp; relaxed in stressful situations.
</p>
<p>
  Tomiki Tomiki Ryu Aikido was founded by Kenji Tomiki, a high ranking judoka,
  whom Jigoro Kano (the founder of Judo) sent to Ueshiba to learn Aikido. The
  primary focus of Tomiki Aikido is kata (forms) that strive to teach and capture
  the fundamentals of Aikido. Tomiki de-emphasized the concept and importance of
  Ki, and instead decided to concentrate on the physiological side of Aikido.
</p>
<p>
  Kokikai A style founded by Shuji Maruyama Sensei. It is a particularly soft
  style that emphasizes 'minimum effort for maximum effect.'
