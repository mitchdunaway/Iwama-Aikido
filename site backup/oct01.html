Check this site soon for many new pictures and a <STRONG>big</STRONG> announcement.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>October 10, 2001 - In further good scheduling news, Friday night is now at 7pm as well. This is hopefully that last schedule change for a while. It is likely that Sensei will teach this Friday.<BR>
David Sunderland will be testing tonight for 2nd kyu. Good luck, David!</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>October 9, 2001 - Whoopee! The Wednesday night class is back to normal. We will resume our 7pm start time as of this week (October 10th). Remember, the next couple of Wednesdays will be Koga stuff to make up for my absences last week. Wear a t-shirt and sweats if you can.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>October 7, 2001 - Big Seminar Announcement - Seiseki Abe Sensei (10th Dan) is going to be teaching a seminar in Irvine. Go to the Seminar section for more information.<BR>
Added links to Iwama Ryu in Europe and No Nonsense Self-Defense in the Links section. I would advise everybody to go to the <A href="http://www.diac.com/~dgordon/index.html">No Nonsense Self-Defense</A> page and read every word.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>October 5, 2001 - Okay, hopefully this is the last time I get new information. Friday has not moved. So, the only schedule change is that Wednesday is now at 8pm. You can always view the <A href="/index.html">Home</A> page for an accurate schedule.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>October 3, 2001 - My apologies about the announcement coming a bit late but there is a schedule change. Hopefully this is just temporary, but for now, Wednesday evenings are going to begin at 8pm. Friday evenings are now going to begin at 7pm.</P>
