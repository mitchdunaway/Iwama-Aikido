<P><B>June 15, 2004</B> - Westlake Village Aikido Students and Friends,<BR>
As most of you probably know by now, David Alexander Sensei is moving out of the area and will be leaving next Monday.  Westlake Village Aikido will be having a going-away party for him <B>this Friday at 6:30pm</B> at my house - 473 Hillsborough St., Thousand Oaks.  <I>There will be no Aikido class that evening.</I><BR>
Alexander Sensei has brought Iwama style aikido to the Thousand Oaks area and a number of us have had the opportunity to study under Alexander Sensei for some years.  This is a rare opportunity as anyone who has observed the martial arts scene knows, and we are fortunate we have had Alexander Sensei here for over 12 years. Now he is moving on and I think it is appropriate that we take time in our busy schedules to say thanks one last time for all he has given us.  I hope to see you all on Friday.<BR>

<P><B>June 11, 2004</B> - Alexander Sensei will likely be moving very soon.  Before he leaves he will be teaching class tonight and next Friday, June 18th.</P>

<P><B>June 1, 2004</B> - Alexander Sensei will be teaching class this Friday, June 4th.<BR>
Congratulations to Jason Ives on passing his 1st kyu exam!</P>
