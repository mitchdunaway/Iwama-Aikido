I envision three separate sub sites
1) Iwama Aikido Main, information about Iwama Aikido
2) Austin dojo
3) Westlake dojo
The naked domain would point to the information page
iwama-aikido.com -> www.iwama-aikido.com
westlake.iwama-aikido.com
austin.iwama-aikido.com

each site would have different header and navigation, but would otherwise be identical in layout and formatting
each site would house information specific only to itself
main navigation on each site would have links directly into the other sites (separation of IA and navigation)

the following documents are needed to illustrate this plan
1) design files showing mockups of home pages, headers, and navigations
2) navigation specifications
3) site maps
4) proposal document

Proposal document parts
1) describe the anecdote that led me to the problem
2) propose solution
3) illustrate solution
4) list necessary changes
5) request access to hosting service control panel
