goal
to show what the main site and the dojo sites will look like and how they will function on the home page and on inside pages in at least three widths. It should also act as a tool for the development of the site. As such, it should do the following things: specify fonts and colors for common html tags, lend itself to easy slicing, demonstrate interactivity, etc.
